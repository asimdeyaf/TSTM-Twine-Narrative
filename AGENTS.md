# AGENTS.md (Twine Workspace)

## Scope
- Applies to `/Users/asimdeyaf/Documents/Twine`.
- Primary target for story-script tasks:
- `/Users/asimdeyaf/Documents/Twine/Stories/tstm-story-script.html`
- Explicitly out-of-scope unless requested:
  - `/Users/asimdeyaf/Documents/Twine/Stories/tstm-animatic.html`

## Working Rules
- Treat the Twine story file as a structured narrative source, not a plain text dump.
- Preserve passage names and branching structure unless a requested change requires structural edits.
- For dialogue synchronization tasks, coordinate with Unity-side VO dialogue sheets under:
  - `Assets/__TSTM__/READMEs/VO_Dialogue/`
- When changes are ambiguous, prefer producing a reconciliation proposal before applying edits.

## Cross-References
- Unity cross-tool sync process:
  - `Assets/__TSTM__/READMEs/Documentation/Process/CrossTool/README-TwineVODSyncWorkflow.md`
- Twine script format standard:
  - `Assets/__TSTM__/READMEs/Documentation/Standards/CrossTool/README-TwineStoryScriptFormat.md`
